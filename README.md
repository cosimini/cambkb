# Yet another split keyboard with low profile Gateron switches

Basically a replica of any other split keyboard project you can find on github
* Pro micro controller
* Gateron low profile KS-33 switchew with hot-swap sockets
* No OLED screen or other BS

The main difference in the layout is that the positions of the thumb-keys is moved to the center with respect to more famous keyboards like the Lily58, more like the Voyager.
Vertical staggin on the home row is 1/4 of a key.
